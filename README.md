## Colophon

This website is designed with a focus on minimalism, mirroring the essence of my identity and creative approach. To ensure a clean and contemporary aesthetic, I have chosen the font "Manrope" as the primary typeface throughout the website. Its modern and versatile characteristics perfectly align with the overall design philosophy.

## Influences

The design is inspired by [Benji Taylor](https://benji.org), [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/), and [Hayden Bleasel](https://haydenbleasel.com/).
